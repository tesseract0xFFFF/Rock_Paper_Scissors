computer choice pseudocode:
//
use a random number generator with a range of 1-3.
store result in a variable.
use switch statements for each random number. there will be 3 cases (rock, paper, scissors).
store the switch case return value in a variable.
//


player choice pesudocode:
//
make sure promt returns a lowercase string. (to fit the comp choices, 
which will also be lowercase. that will help with comparisons that will be performed later).
store prompt value in a variable.

//



choice evaluation pseuodocode:
//

check for valid inputs (rock, paper, scissors).
(use the NOT operator to make it easier to determine whether an input is valid or not).

check for (r,r), (p,p), (s,s) cases by comparing both inputs (must be of same type and value, case included).
check will be performed by comaring both strings after they have been normalized to lowercase.

check for cases in which the player wins. use the OR operator in an 'if' statement.
the else case will be if the computer won.
