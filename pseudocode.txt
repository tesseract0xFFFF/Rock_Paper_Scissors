computer choice pseudocode:
//
create a result array.
use a random number generator with a range of 1-3. 
use the math.random() function to generate a random number between 0-1 and then multiply it by the array's length. then, use the math.floor() function to return the rounded value. 
that value will then be used as an index in the result array.
store result in a variable.

//


player choice pesudocode:
//
create an array that stores valid input options.
make sure promt returns a lowercase string. (to fit the comp choices, 
which will also be lowercase. that will help with comparisons that will be performed later).
store prompt value in a variable.
check if player entered valid options.

//



choice evaluation pseuodocode:
//

check for valid inputs (rock, paper, scissors).
(use the NOT operator to make it easier to determine whether an input is valid or not).

check for (r,r), (p,p), (s,s) cases by comparing both inputs (must be of same type and value, case included).
check will be performed by comaring both strings after they have been normalized to lowercase.

check for cases in which the player wins. use the OR operator in an 'if' statement.
the else case will be if the computer won.
